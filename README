DBLP-REFER
==========

This program converts DBLP API search results to Troff refer
records.

The dblp.sh wrapper script uses curl to query dblp.org for
the given keywords and prints the resulting records after
converting them.  It can be invoked as follows:

  $ ./dblp.sh "general position subset selection"
